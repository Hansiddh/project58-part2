        <p1>It gives you knowledge: Reading is the best way to pass your time when you are alone or even when you are travelling. You get good knowledge about people, places and other activities from the books. Even reading novels and story books give you enough knowledge about the things being talked in it.Then there are books for serious reading. They include works of literature, history, culture, philosophy and many be called books for all times and ages. Such books are indented for the sober and thoughtful minds. A student of literature comes in contact with the master minds of all ages and finds a good deal of food for his thought. They give him an insight into the spiritual values of life. He can thus make his life noble and sublime. His outlook is widened and the field of human sympathy broadened.

            Now we come to the most important question, viz. how to read books? Beacon has said, “some books are to be tasted, others are to be swallowed and some few to be chewed and digested.” To treat a book has the sense of compulsion. This compulsion many be useful, but it kills all interest. Nobody can appreciate such a temporary love of books. A real lover of books enjoys their company all the time.</p1>
